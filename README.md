## Installation
This is a node application that runs in the terminal, so in order to install it you will need to copy the repository to your local machine, and ensure to npm install all the necessary packages required.  You will also need to input your password for MySQL either into the code itself or into a .env folder.  Once that has happened you will need to run the scheme.sql and seeds.sql into MySQL Workbench or equivalent to have the necessary database.


## Usage 
Once all packages are installed and database has been setup, you will run the following in your console "node server.js" and this will initiliaze the application.  You will make selections based on what action you would like to perform and input the requested information.  Once you are done you may exit the application and the information will be input to your table.



## Credits
I utlized MySQL for this as well as the npm packages, Inquirer, dotenv, and console.table.
